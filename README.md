## Loops
* **While Loop**: Similar to a for loop, but the increment is done inside the loop body. Variables are usually declared before the while loop.
* **Do While Loop**: The code runs at least one time even if the condition is false because the condition is checked after the loop body.
* **For Loop**: The most commonly used loop. Initialization, condition, and increment are written in one line.

## Types of Functions
* No argument, no return type
* Argument but no return type
* No argument but return type
* Both argument and return type
